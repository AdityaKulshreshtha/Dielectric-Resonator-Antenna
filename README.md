# Dielectric-Resonator-Antenna
Here I have designed a Cylindrical Dielectric Resonator Antenna[CDRA] which consists of ground , substrate , patch , cylindrical DRA,microstrip feedline , rectangular slab which is right in the middle of the two CDRA's. The slab is just placed so as to reduce the coupling between these CDRA's and Increase the gain and directivity of our schematic . It operates in C-band [4-8GHz] with a resonating frequency at 7.3 GHz . In this range of frequency, we find various applications in 5G communications and satellite communications technologies.
